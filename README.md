# Hilo
Do you like almost even odds? Are you interested in taking chances to see if you 
can win? Give Hilo a chance. It's a very simple card game. You start off with 300 points.

The dealer gives you one card face up. You get to call if you think the next card 
dealt will be higher or lower. 

If you get it right, you get 100 points, but if 
you get it wrong you lose 75 points. Keep playing until your points reach 0, until you 
decide to stop.

If you want to play again, the new card now becomes the 'old' card, and you guess if 
you think the next card dealt will be higher or lower than that one.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.
